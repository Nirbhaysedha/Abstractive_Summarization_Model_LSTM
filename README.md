# Abstractive Text Summarization using Sequence-to-Sequence Model with Attention and Coverage Mechanisms ( LSTM )

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for my Abstractive Text Summarization project using a Sequence-to-Sequence model with Attention and Coverage Mechanisms. The project is aimed at generating concise and meaningful summaries from lengthy text documents, particularly leveraging the powerful capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: Utilized the Daily Mail dataset, which provides extensive text articles suitable for summarization tasks.
- **Preprocessing**: Performed thorough text processing using NLP techniques such as tokenization, vectorization, and data cleaning to prepare the data for the model.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Integrated an attention mechanism to allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input text during the summarization process.
- **Coverage Mechanism**: Implemented a coverage vector to mitigate text repetition in the generated summaries. This helps in reducing redundancy and making sure that the model doesn't repeatedly attend to the same parts of the input text.
- **ROUGE Evaluation**: Employed the ROUGE metrics for evaluating the quality of generated summaries. ROUGE measures the overlap between the reference summary and the generated summary.
- **Generated Summaries**: Produced abstractive summaries that capture the essence of the input text, making them suitable for conveying the main ideas of the original documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Additional packages as mentioned in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Nirbhaysedha/Abstractive_Summarization_Model_LSTM.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`

### Usage


1. Preprocess your data using NLP techniques: tokenization, vectorization, data cleaning, etc.
2. Run the training script to train the sequence-to-sequence model with attention and coverage mechanisms.
3. Generate summaries using the trained model.
4. Evaluate the generated summaries using ROUGE metrics.

## Results

Include any insights, statistics, or comparisons showcasing the performance of your model. You can also provide some examples of input text and the generated summaries.
